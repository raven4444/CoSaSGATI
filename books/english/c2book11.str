A thief comes, on a mission that will put us all to shame.  He will seek to take the instrument of my power and, disguising its form, make it destroy the bane of fire and be destroyed in turn.  The power of its wielder will be destroyed, along with my own.

Tonight I will be a flame to banish the shadows; no thief will creep past my unsleeping alertness.  If the rogue succeeds, my fire will be diminished, but if he is caught, it shall burn higher with the fuel of his corpse."
