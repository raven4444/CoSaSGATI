I DEMAND that the ... person ... who has brought in that wretched creature - you know what I mean, that infant reptile, be removed from this establishment IMMEDIATELY.  I do not dare go downstairs from my room, for the stench permeates, and fills me with vomit. I WILL NOT PAY unless you meet my demand!
